MCDungeon

MCDungeon will create a procedurally generated dungeon in a preexisting
Minecraft map. It is not yet feature complete, but can already generate
dungeons with quite a bit of variety. It is written in Python and
makes use of code from Paul Hodge's minetown project and David Rio
Vierra's pymclevel. This was inspired by BeeTLe BeTHLeHeM's MCMapper.

CURRENT FEATURES:

   * Automatically finds a good location on a map based on range, size, and
     depth parameters. Can detect player structures and try not to overwrite
     them. 

   * Dungeons can be removed from a map later and the landscape allowed to
     regenerate. 

   * Dungeons can be regenerated in place with a new layout, mobs, and 
     treasure.

   * Can generate multiple dungeon in a map, or try to fill the map with as
     many dungeons as possible.

   * Generates room layouts based on a random weighted selection
     of rooms. Rooms are filled with random hallways, floors, room
     features, and ruins on the surface, all of which are configurable.

   * The density and placement of doors, portcullises, and torches are 
     configurable. Option to place fewer torches as levels go down. Less 
     light == more danger!

   * A "hard mode" that will fill in nearby natural caves in an attempt to
     concentrate random monster spawns inside the dungeon, add more traps,
     and make silverfish extremely common. 

   * Places stairwells between levels, and a random entrance with a
     spiraling staircase. Some entrances have a configurable height so it 
     can be seen from far away.

   * Optionally places a MultiVerse (Craftbukkit plugin) portal at
     the bottom of the dungeon to teleport players out to the world of
     your choice.

   * Places chests with loot around the dungeon in (probably) hard
     to reach places. An arbitrary number of loot tables can be configured
     to provide variety. The density of chests is configurable. 

   * Places mob spawners throughout the dungeon. These will likely be near
     chests, but not always. Mob types are configurable. The density of
     spawners is configurable. Some 'non-standard' mobs are available. ;)

   * Random placement of secret traps and puzzles.

   * Output floor maps to a terminal with color on ANSI systems.

   * Output entire dungeon maps to HTML.

TODO:

   * More room, hall, floor, feature, and ruin types.
   * More traps!
   * Harder hard mode!
   * More stuff as Minecraft evolves!

QUICK START:

Go to the wiki! http://mcdungeon.wikkii.com/wiki/Quick_Start

List available subcommands and options:

./mcdungeon.py --help

Help on a specific subcommand:

./mcdungeon.py <subcommand> --help

EXAMPLES:

Load a world named 'Dungeon' in the current directory, generate a
5x4x3 dungeon layout (5 rooms E/W, 4 rooms N/S, and 3 levels deep)
and display the results in a terminal window. (In color on ANSI
terminals only. Sorry Windows) The world files will not be modified,
but are required. Basically a "dry run."

./mcdungeon.py add Dungeon 5 4 3 --term 1

Generate five random dungeons between the sizes of 4x4x5 and 6x6x8 and 
save them to the world.

./mcdungeon.py add Dungeon 4-6 4-6 5-8 -n 5 --write

Run in interactive mode. From here you can add, list, delete or regenerate
dungeons.

./mcdungeon interactive
